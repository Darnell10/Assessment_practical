the test was fairly easy. Certain things like making the keypad disappear, i was able to find with a goog search.
did not get to set up the method for subtracting cards from the deck or showing the suit and value when the image view is clicked
again time. I did improve on time managment. 
I had trouble with networking because I forgot to make it an interface.
